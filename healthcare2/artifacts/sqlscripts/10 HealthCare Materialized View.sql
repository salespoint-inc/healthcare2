/* Materialized View also know as snapshots in Azure Synapse is Snapshots acts like a physical table 
because data from snapshots are storing in to physical memory.Snapshot retrieves data very fast.
So for performance tuning Snapshots are used
Let's see how we can implement this in Azure Synapse.*/
--Step 1 MV_PatientDetails is a Materialized view that count the number of patients city wise.
DROP view IF EXISTS MV_PatientDetails
GO
Create MATERIALIZED view MV_PatientDetails
WITH (distribution = HASH(city),FOR_APPEND)
as
select count(Id) as patient_count,city from dbo.synpatient
WHERE city is NOT NULL
group by city

--Step 2 City wise patient count
select patient_count,city from MV_PatientDetails

--Step 3 We can filter data for any specific city
select patient_count,city from MV_PatientDetails WHERE city='New Boston'
